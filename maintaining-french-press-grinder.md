# Maintaining Your French Press Grinder: Cleaning and Care Tips

Keeping your burr grinder in top shape ensures that every French press brew tastes its best. When coffee oils and fine dust build up inside a grinder, they can cause rancid flavours and strain the motor【752274711890024†L314-L323】. Regular maintenance prevents these problems and prolongs the life of your equipment.

## Routine cleaning after each use

After grinding coffee, small particles cling to the burrs and hopper. If left in place they oxidise and stale, imparting bitter, rancid flavours to your next brew【752274711890024†L314-L323】. To prevent this, wipe down the hopper and chute with a dry cloth and use a soft‑bristled brush to sweep loose grounds from the burrs【752274711890024†L328-L337】. Avoid moisture—water can cause metal burrs to rust or encourage mould growth. For French press brewing, where grinds are coarse and oilier, a quick brush out after each session keeps the grind path clean.

## Use grinder‑cleaning tablets

For a deeper clean without taking your grinder apart, dedicated cleaning pellets such as Urnex Grindz can be run through the grinder. The tablets absorb coffee oils and scrub residue from the burrs【752274711890024†L342-L350】. After grinding the pellets, grind a handful of sacrificial coffee to flush out any remaining powder. Don’t use rice; its hardness and starch can damage burrs and gum up the mechanism【752274711890024†L353-L365】.

## Periodic deep cleaning

Every few months, or whenever you notice stale flavours, perform a full deep clean. Unplug the grinder and remove the hopper and burr carrier. Brush or vacuum out all grounds and wipe the surfaces with a dry cloth【752274711890024†L370-L392】. Avoid using water or soap, as moisture can lead to corrosion. Once reassembled, “re‑season” the burrs by grinding a small amount of old coffee to coat the surfaces with oils again【752274711890024†L395-L405】. This step restores the static‑fighting slickness that helps beans feed evenly.

## When to replace burrs

Even with careful cleaning, burrs wear down over time. Dull burrs produce inconsistent particle sizes, causing over‑ and under‑extraction【976175247851960†L392-L399】. Signs of wear include sluggish grinding, hot grounds, or the need to tighten the setting more than usual【976175247851960†L315-L363】. Home users should replace steel burrs every one to two years (or after grinding around 1,000–1,500 kg of beans)【976175247851960†L382-L390】. Ceramic burrs last slightly longer but will also eventually need replacement.
